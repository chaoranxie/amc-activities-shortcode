# AMC Activities Shortcode WordPress Plugin

[AMC Activities Shortcode](https://bitbucket.org/graybirch/amc-actdb-shortcode) is a WordPress plugin to pull and format selected trips/activities from the [AMC Activities Database](https://activities.outdoors.org/).

The AMC provides a simple API that returns a list of activities in XML format for the use of its member chapters. This plugin will format a query to the API and parse the returned list into valid HTML structure that is returned through the shortcode handler for display on the WordPress front end.

## Features

The plugin creates a WordPress shortcode that can be used in any page, post or section that supports shortcodes. The shortcode format is

    [amc_actdb chapter=id committee=id activity=id display=[short|long] limit=n]

The chapter ID is mandatory. All other attributes are optional, but it is recommended to us other parameters (committee, activity or limit) to restrict the list as [amc_actdb chapter=xx] by itself will return **all** future activities from the database.

The ***display*** attribute controls whether the plugin renders the events in short
or long format. 

- *Short* format displays the event title, date, status, type & level and the trip leader name and email. 

- In addition to the details in the short format, the *long* format includes the event description and a featured image if one was provided for the event.

The ***limit*** attribute controls how many events are displayed. The events are returned in chronological order so using limit=5 would restrict the display to the next 5 upcoming events.

Functionality to retrieve prior events is not available in the API.

* PHP >= 7.1
