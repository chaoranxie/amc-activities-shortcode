# AMC Activities Shortcode WordPress Plugin

[AMC Activities Shortcode](https://github.com/graybirchsolutions/amc-actdb-shortcode) is a WordPress plugin to pull selected trips/activities from the [AMC Activities Database](https://activities.outdoors.org/) and display them in a calendar/agenda format on any WordPress-based website.

## Features

The plugin creates a WordPress shortcode that can be used in any page, post or section that supports shortcodes. The shortcode format is

    [amc_actdb chapter=id committee=id activity=id limit=n display=short|long]

The chapter ID is mandatory. All other attributes are optional, but it is recommended to use other parameters (committee, activity or limit) to restrict the list as [amc_actdb chapter=xx] by itself will return **all** future activities from the database.

The ***display*** attribute controls whether the plugin renders the events in short or long format. 

- *Short* format displays the event title, date, status, type & level and the trip leader name and email. 

- In addition to the details in the short format, the *long* format includes the event description and a featured image if one was provided for the event.

The ***limit*** attribute controls how many events are displayed. The events are returned in chronological order so using limit=5 would restrict the display to the next 5 upcoming events.

Functionality to retrieve past events is not available through the AMC's API, so the plugin cannot display past events.

## Requirements

* PHP >= 7.1
* WordPress >= 5.2
